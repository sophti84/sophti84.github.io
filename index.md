## About Me

I am a second-year undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a> studying cognitive science and mathematics. Research-wise, my interests lie in decision-making and behavioral forecasting, and I am currently a research assistant to <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/tetlock/">Philip Tetlock</a>, studying the applications of sentiment analysis to predictions of US-China tensions.

In a former life, I was quite involved in speech and debate. If you are a debater looking for resources, feel free to check out my past projects, <a href="https://ld.circuitdebater.org/w/index.php/Prospect_ST_(Sophia_Tian)">CircuitDebater</a> and <a href="https://www.windebate.org/">Women in Debate</a>. I am currently a coach for the <a href="https://www.harker.org/">Harker School</a>, and, outside of debate, I teach in West Philadelphia schools through the <a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/penn-cssp/">Community School Student Partnerships</a> program.
