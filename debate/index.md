## About Me

**June 22, 2025:** This page is still a work-in-progress; more things to come soon!

Hello! I'm Sophia, and I debated for [Prospect High School](https://prospect.cuhsd.org/) from 2020 to 2024. I am now a second-year undergraduate at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) and a coach for the [Harker School](https://www.harker.org/). Because [CircuitDebater](https://circuitdebater.org/w/index.php/Main_Page) is often down nowadays (Russian bots are *really* aggressive, I guess), I've shifted a lot of my CircuitDebater [page](https://circuitdebater.org/w/index.php/Prospect_ST_(Sophia_Tian)) to this website. However, I still highly encourage you to check out some of the articles I've written there, like [Introduction to Theory](https://circuitdebater.org/w/index.php/Theory), that are not linked to this page.

As a debater, I primarily dabbled in philosophy, later branching out to theory and tricks debate. I get several questions asking about prep, small school debate, and philosophy, so I thought I'd answer them here. I have also attached my prep for each topic with explanations below.

As always, thank you to the friends, coaches, and people who shaped my debate views and made this activity worth doing: Elmer Yang, Samantha McLoughlin, Raffi Piliero, Danielle Dosch, Nina Potischman, Marshall Bierson, Jack Wareham, Varun Bhave, Pacy Yan, Andrew Garber, Max Perin, Zachary Siegel, Ava Manaker, Iris Chen, among others.

Feel free to contact me with any questions at sophti84 [at] upenn.edu!

## Prep

I have included below all of the positions that I read and cut myself. Policy positions read between 2022-2024 were likely cut by Elmer Yang, Samantha McLoughlin, or my teammates on McYang Gang (Anika Ganesh, Tanya Wei, Pranav Gorty, David Xu, Andrew Park, and Yesh Rao - #Coast2Coast). Policy positions read between 2021-2023 were likely cut by Elmer Yang or my teammates on SSADrills (Ava Manaker and Shrey Raju).
