## About

June 22, 2025: This page is still a work-in-progress; more things to come soon!

Hello! I'm Sophia, and I debated for Prospect High School from 2020 to 2024. I am now a second-year undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania and a coach for the Harker School. Because CircuitDebater is often down nowadays (Russian bots are getting more aggressive, I suppose), I've shifted a lot of my CircuitDebater page to this website. However, I still highly encourage you to check out some of the articles I've written there, like Introduction to Theory.

As a debater, I primarily dabbled in philosophy, later branching out to theory and tricks debate. I get several questions asking about prep, small school debate, and philosophy, so I thought I'd answer them here. I have also attached my prep for each topic with explanations below.

As always, thank you to the friends, coaches, and people who shaped my debate views and made this activity as fun as it was: Elmer Yang, Samantha McLoughlin, Raffi Piliero, Danielle Dosch, Nina Potischman, Marshall Bierson, Jack Wareham, Varun Bhave, Pacy Yan, Andrew Garber, Max Perin, Zachary Siegel, Ava Manaker, Iris Chen, and many others.

Feel free to contact me with any questions at sophti84 [at] upenn.edu!
